Simon Says game as a quick coding sample using Angular 1.6

I was asked to put together a Simon Says game using front end technologies. I chose to use Angular. I like Angular because it is really easy to get something prototyped fast.

There's a text document that has more information and limitations info. This game is in no way complete, but just gives the main idea of the game. My goal was to keep it really simple.
