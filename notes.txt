Game doesn't allow multiple players
I set it to go to 15 steps before it is over.
It doesn't evaluate every press just until you get to the end of a sequence. This should be fixed to evaluate each press at a time.
I didn't do much with the graphics, just used html, css and javascript
The audio files needs to be compressed.
It doesn't prevent you from pressing the lenses more times than you should
