Notes:
Game doesn't allow multiple players
I set it to go to 15 steps before it is over.
It doesn't evaluate every press just until you get to the end of a sequence. This should be fixed to evaluate each press at a time.
I didn't do much with the graphics, just used html, css and javascript
The audio files need to be compressed and change filetypes.
It doesn't prevent you from pressing the lenses more times than you should
You press start to start a new game.
I could have made it so it could be resized, but the elements are just roughly positioned.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
